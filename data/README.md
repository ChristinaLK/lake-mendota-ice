## Data README

The data for this project was taken from the following link, on Monday, December 14, 2020: 
* https://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/lakes/Mendota-ice.html

Each column of data was copy and pasted into a spreadsheet. Where there are 
multiple rows for the same winter season, the quote mark `"` was manually 
replaced by a duplicate of the previous row. Similarly, the date formats 
were manually confirmed to be consistent. This data is in the `ice-raw.csv` file.
